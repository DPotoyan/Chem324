1. **The Probabilistic Nature of the Quantum World**  
   The quantum realm operates on fundamentally probabilistic principles, where certainty is replaced by probabilities.

2. **Wave Function and Probability Distribution**  
   The absolute square of the wave function, $|\psi|^2$, represents the probability distribution of finding a quantum particle in space and time.

### What is the meaning of a wave-function $\psi$ ? 

- In the classical wave equation, the wave function has a clear mechanical interpretation: it represents the degree of disturbance in the wave. For example, it can describe the elevation of a guitar string from its resting position.

- In contrast, the quantum wave function is less intuitive. The wave function itself does not have direct physical meaning, as it is generally a complex function. To connect it to measurable quantities, we need to extract real values from it that correspond to physical observables.

- The key insight is that the absolute square of the wave function gives the probability distribution:

  $$p(x) = \psi^{*}(x) \cdot \psi(x) = |\psi(x)|^2$$

- $p(x)$ is a **probability distribution function**. It is describing the likelihood of finding a quantum object at a positions x. 
- $p(x)dx$ gives the probability to find particle in a tiny part of space inside $x, x+dx$ interval.

- In three-dimensional space, the analogous expression is:

  $$p(x, y, z) = \psi(x, y, z)^{*} \cdot \psi(x, y, z)$$
