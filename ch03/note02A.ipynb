    "   The Particle in a Box (PIB) is a simple model that helps illustrate the behavior of electrons confined within atoms and molecules. It serves as a useful tool to introduce key quantum concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Energetic Quantization**: Energy levels in quantum systems are discrete, not continuous, as seen in the PIB model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Probabilistic Nature of Quantum Particles**: The probability distribution for the particle's position is non-uniform, with nodal points where the probability is zero, emphasizing the inherent uncertainty in the particle’s exact location.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Uncertainty Principle**: There is an inverse relationship between the uncertainty in position and momentum, demonstrating the fundamental limit on how precisely both quantities can be known simultaneously.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Zero-Point Energy**: Quantum particles always possess a minimum kinetic energy, even at absolute zero. This zero-point energy highlights the impossibility of freezing all motion in quantum systems.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Quantum-Classical Correspondence**: As the system scales up, quantum behavior smoothly transitions to classical behavior, illustrating the correspondence principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Degeneracy of Energy Levels**: In systems with symmetries, multiple wave functions can correspond to the same energy level, a phenomenon known as degeneracy.\n",
