    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By treating functions as vectors and operators as matrices, quantum mechanics becomes a powerful framework for solving complex problems. Operations like differentiation, integration, and multiplication by physical observables can be represented as matrix operations, which leads to efficient numerical methods in computational quantum mechanics."
