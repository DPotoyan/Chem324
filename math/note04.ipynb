    "A **vector** is an ordered collection of numbers that can describe various properties of physical or mathematical systems. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $a = (-2, 8)$: A 2D vector.\n",
    "  - $b = (1.34, 4.23, 5.98)$: A 3D vector.\n",
    "  - $c = (1, -2, 4i, 3 + 2i)$: A 4D vector with complex components.\n",

    "### Vectors Defined with Respect to a Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "- In classical physics, vectors are often visualized as arrows in space, with both **magnitude** and **direction**. A vector is typically defined with respect to a **basis**, where unit vectors ($\\vec{e_i}$) span the space. For instance, in 3D Euclidean space, the standard basis is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$e_1 = (1, 0, 0), \\,\\, e_2 = (0, 1, 0), \\,\\, e_3 = (0, 0, 1)$$\n",
