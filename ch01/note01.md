## Why Quantum Mechanics?

:::{admonition} What you need to know
:class: note
- **Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory of nature**, governing atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles.  
- Quantum theories (quantum mechanics + quantum field theory) are **complete descriptions of physical reality**‚Äîand they‚Äôve never failed an experimental test since their discovery.  
- Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified to an **astonishing degree of accuracy**.

Quantum mechanics provides the framework to understand, describe, and predict the behavior of the smallest particles‚Äîso long as they don‚Äôt travel near light speed.

### Beware: Quantum Mechanics is Weird ü§Ø  

- Saying QM is ‚Äúweird‚Äù is an understatement. Don‚Äôt just take my word for it‚Äîconsider Richard Feynman:

[Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), Nobel Prize in Physics (1965) for his groundbreaking work on quantum electrodynamics.

- Be prepared to let go of the comforting notion that ‚Äúthings make sense.‚Äù In quantum land, they often don‚Äôt! But that doesn‚Äôt stop us from **mastering the logic** of quantum mechanics and applying it everywhere‚Äîfrom chemistry to computing.  

> Bottom line: if you feel you don‚Äôt fully understand QM, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîyou‚Äôre in good company‚Ä¶ with *everyone else*!  




### How Does Quantum Mechanics Compare to Other Theories?

‚ÄúThere are no quantum mechanicians. Electrons don‚Äôt break down, but your car does!‚Äù

Even though discovered by physicists, QM isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúanother‚Äù physical theory like electromagnetism or relativity.  

In the usual hierarchy of sciences (biology ‚Üí chemistry ‚Üí physics ‚Üí math), quantum mechanics sits in a unique position‚Äîlike the **operating system** on which other theories run as ‚Äúapps.‚Äù Translating a theory into this OS is what physicists call *quantization*.

### What Skills Will You Gain?  

Studying quantum mechanics will arm you with tools beyond physics:  

- **Probabilistic thinking** and comfort with uncertainty  
- **Linear algebra + differential equations** at a deeper, applied level  
- Ability to **decode electronic structure calculations** in cutting-edge research (chemistry, biochemistry, materials, astrophysics)  
- Insight into **chemical bonding, spectroscopy, and reactivity**  
- A more nuanced appreciation of the complex world we live in  




### And One More Thing‚Ä¶  

If none of the above convinces you, remember: studying quantum mechanics also upgrades your meme game.
