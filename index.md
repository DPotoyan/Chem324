Overview
============================


``` {admonition} 
:class: note
- This website is designed as a supplementary material for the course **Chem 324: Introductory Quantum Mechanics**  taught at the Iowa State University. 
- The main objective, is to introduce sceintific computation whcih lowers the barier for understanding complex mathematical concepts of quantum mechanics
- Website contains lecture notes, jupyter notebooks written in python3 and other media content.
- The website is not a subsitute for a good textbook.   
```

### How to use the website

- No programing expreience is assumed. Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course .

- You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of these notes, however, you should run the code blocks and explore the interactive content in the notebooks. 

    - You can run all of the notebooks in the cloud using Google Collab. This option requires no installation and any notebook or tablet can be used!

    - You can also run notebooks locally in jupyter notebook/lab. This options Requires installing anaconda python distribution and all the required packages which can be found on github repository.

### Comments? Questions?
