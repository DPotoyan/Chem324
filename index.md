Overview
============================

``` {note}
This website provides computational and media content for the course **Chem 324: Introductory Quantum Mechanics**  taught at the Iowa State University. A major goal of introducing computation is to demystify complex mathematical concepts of quantum mechanics. Thanks to numerical examples students get to go beyond pencil and paper examples and see the bigger picture of how quantum theory is used to solve all kinds of problems in chemistry, physics and material science.

### How to use the content

- No programing expreience is assumed. Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course .

- You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of these notes, however, you should run the code blocks and explore the interactive content in the notebooks. 

    - You can run all of the notebooks in the cloud using Google Collab. This option requires no installation and any notebook or tablet can be used!

    - You can also run notebooks locally in jupyter notebook/lab. This options Requires installing anaconda python distribution and all the required packages which can be found on github repository.

### Comments? Questions?

For feedback or corrections please go to the Github page of the course, open an issue and leave your comments, questions and suggestions. I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the developent of the course please get in touch. I would love to have more people engaged in improving the course and reaching out to wider scientific and engineering community.
