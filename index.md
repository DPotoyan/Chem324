Overview
============================


``` {admonition} 
:class: note
- This website is designed as a supplementary material for the course **Chem 324: Introductory Quantum Mechanics**  taught at the Iowa State University. 
- The main objective, is to integreate sceintific computation and visualization whcih lowers the barier for understanding complex mathematical concepts of quantum mechanics
- Website contains lecture notes, jupyter notebooks written in python3 and other media content.
- The rapid rise of AI is creating new opportunities for learning STEM subjects where computational, data analysis and visualization play ever more important roles. This website is meant to fill the gap between existing textbooks and modern search engines (Chat GPT, etc).
- Note, however that this website is not a subsitute for a textbook.   
```

### How to use the website

- No programing expreience is assumed. You can just read the book chapters on website or download notes as pdf. 

    - There are computational demos which will be used to illustrate concepts of quantum mechanics. You do not need to know any programming to understand those. 

    - Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course to help you play with the itneractive content if you wish so. 

    - You can run all of the notebooks in the cloud using Google Collab. This option requires no installation and any notebook or tablet can be used!

    - You can also run notebooks locally in jupyter notebook/lab. This options Requires installing anaconda python distribution and all the required packages which can be found on github repository.

### Comments? Questions?

For feedback or corrections please go to the Github page of the course, open an issue and leave your comments, questions and suggestions. I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the developent of the course please get in touch. I would love to have more people engaged in improving the course and reaching out to wider scientific and engineering community.
