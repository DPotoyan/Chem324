The conclusions of these experiments forced us to abandon classical mechanics for a more fundamental and complete (quantum) theory of the world that can explain phenomena down to smallest particles including atoms, molecules and photons."

On the other hand low frequency waves can be generated in your “microwave” which you may use to heat up that leftover pizza! The light that is visible to our eyes is located in a narrow frequency region somewhere in between."
