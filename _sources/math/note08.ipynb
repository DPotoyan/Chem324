    "# Application: Hopfield Neural Networks \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Hopfield network** is a type of recurrent neural network where all neurons are connected to each other. It is commonly used for **associative memory**—storing and recalling patterns. The network evolves to a stable state, recalling a stored pattern when given noisy or incomplete input. We can understand its behavior using matrix and vector operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Hopfield Network\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neurons (States)**:\n",
    "   Each neuron has a binary state, either $1$ (active) or $-1$ (inactive). The state of all neurons is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{s}$. For a network of 3 neurons, the state vector might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weights (Connections)**:\n",
    "   Neurons are connected by weights, represented by a symmetric matrix $W$. For a 3-neuron network, the weight matrix might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   W = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "   0 & w_{12} & w_{13} \\\\\n",
    "   w_{21} & 0 & w_{23} \\\\\n",
    "   w_{31} & w_{32} & 0\n",
    "   \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The diagonal elements are zero because a neuron does not connect to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Rule**:\n",
    "   To update the state of neuron $i$, we calculate the weighted sum of inputs from all other neurons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   h_i = \\sum_{j} w_{ij} s_j = (W \\mathbf{s})_i\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   If $h_i > 0$, the neuron becomes active ($s_i = 1$). If $h_i < 0$, the neuron becomes inactive ($s_i = -1$).\n",

    "### Example: Simple Hopfield Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a 3-neuron Hopfield network with the following weight matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "-1 & 1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the initial state of the network is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "We update each neuron based on the weighted inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neuron 1**:\n",
    "   The input to neuron 1 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   h_1 = W_{11}s_1 + W_{12}s_2 + W_{13}s_3 = 0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (-1) + (-1) \\cdot 1 = -2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since $h_1 < 0$, the new state of neuron 1 is $s_1 = -1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neuron 2**:\n",
    "   The input to neuron 2 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   h_2 = W_{21}s_1 + W_{22}s_2 + W_{23}s_3 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot (-1) + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since $h_2 > 0$, the new state of neuron 2 is $s_2 = 1$.\n",

    "3. **Neuron 3**:\n",
    "   The input to neuron 3 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   h_3 = W_{31}s_1 + W_{32}s_2 + W_{33}s_3 = (-1) \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (-1) + 0 \\cdot 1 = -2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since $h_3 < 0$, the new state of neuron 3 is $s_3 = -1$.\n",

    "### Storing Patterns and Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hopfield network stores specific patterns by adjusting the weights, and it evolves to minimize its **energy**. The energy of the network is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} s_i s_j = -\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{s}^T W \\mathbf{s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the network updates, it reduces its energy until it reaches a stable state, which corresponds to one of the stored patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neurons** are represented by a state vector $\\mathbf{s}$.\n",
    "- **Weights** between neurons are represented by a matrix $W$.\n",
    "- Neurons update their states based on the weighted sum of inputs, which is a matrix-vector multiplication.\n",
    "- The network evolves to stable patterns by minimizing its energy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic introduction to the Hopfield network using matrix and vector operations. "
