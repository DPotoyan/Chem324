    "### Vectors as Arrays of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector** is an ordered collection of numbers that can describe various properties of physical or mathematical systems. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $a = (-2, 8)$: A 2D vector.\n",
    "  - $b = (1.34, 4.23, 5.98)$: A 3D vector.\n",
    "  - $c = (1, -2, 4i, 3 + 2i)$: A 4D vector with complex components.\n",
    "  - $f = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \\ldots, \\infty)$: An infinite-dimensional vector with integer components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Vectors can belong to real or complex spaces, depending on their components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors Defined with Respect to a Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "- In classical physics, vectors are often visualized as arrows in space, with both **magnitude** and **direction**. A vector is typically defined with respect to a **basis**, where unit vectors ($\\vec{e_i}$) span the space. For instance, in 3D Euclidean space, the standard basis is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$e_1 = (1, 0, 0), \\,\\, e_2 = (0, 1, 0), \\,\\, e_3 = (0, 0, 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here is an example of vector $v$ in terms of unit vectors of euclidean space.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$v = (2,3,4) = 2e_1+3e_2+4e_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a different coordinate system or basis, the same vector will have different components, but its intrinsic properties remain unchanged. This flexibility in representation is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Vector expressed in two different basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a 2D vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in the standard Cartesian basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{b_1} = 2 \\mathbf{e_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b_2} = 2 \\mathbf{e_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This shows that when moving to a new basis the components of the vector change accordingly, but the vector itself remains the same geometrically!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the context, we may emphasize the basis or omit it when the basis is implied:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In terms of a coordinate basis:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\vec{a} = 2\\vec{e_i} + 3\\vec{e_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - As an ordered tuple of components:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$a = (2, 3)$$\n",

    "  - Using Dirac notation (common in quantum mechanics):  \n",
    "  \n",
