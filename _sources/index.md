``` {note}
This website hosts jupyter notebooks containing computational content for the course “Chem 324: Quantum Mechanics for Chemistry”  taught at the Department of Chemistry of Iowa State University. 
```

- The only pre-requiestes are having taken a calculus and general chemistry courses.

- No programing expreience is assumed. Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course in an accessible manner.

- You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of these notes you should execute code blocks and explore the interactive content in the notebooks. There are several ways to use notebook content:

- You can run all of the notebooks in the cloud using Google Collab. This option requires no installations

- You can also run notebooks locally in jupyter notebook/lab. This options Requires installing anaconda python distribution and all the required packages which can be found on github repository.

### Comments? Questions?
