Overview
============================


``` {admonition} 
:class: note
- This website is designed as a supplementary material for the course **Chem 324: Introductory Quantum Mechanics**  taught at the Iowa State University. 
- The main objective, is to integreate sceintific computation and visualization whcih lowers the barier for understanding complex mathematical concepts of quantum mechanics
- Website contains lecture notes, jupyter notebooks written in python3 and other media content.
- The rapid rise of AI is creating new opportunities for learning STEM subjects where computational, data analysis and visualization play ever more important roles. This website is meant to fill the gap between existing textbooks and modern search engines (Chat GPT, etc).
- Note, however that this website is not a subsitute for a textbook.

### How to use this website

- The website consist of lecture notes along with interactive content (plots, youtube videos, gifs and code blocks) which you can browse on your laptop or faovrite tablet. You can also download notes as pdf and print for offline reading. 

- No programing expreience is assumed or needed to succeed in the class. However you might be tempted to learn some coding once you see some wicked cool demos :) 

- Speaking of which, the computational demos will be used to illustrate various esoteric concepts of quantum mechanics. This will eliminate the need for some time consuming and repetitive math exercises

- Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course to help you follow the demos and give you skiils to play with the itneractive content in your free time. 

- Computational demos can be run as notebooks in the cloud using Google Collab. This option requires no installation and any notebook or tablet can be used!

- You can also download and run notebooks locally in your jupyter notebook/lab or vscode. This options requires having python distribution and installing a few packages

### Comments? Questions?

- For feedback or corrections please go to the Github page of the course, open an issue and leave your comments, questions and suggestions. I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions. 
- If you are interested in contributing to the developent of the course please get in touch. I would love to have more people engaged in improving the course and reaching out to wider scientific and engineering community.
