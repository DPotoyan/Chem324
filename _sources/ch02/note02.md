## Wave equation

:::{admonition} What you need to know
:class: note

- **Wave Equation Overview:** The wave equation, a partial differential equation (PDE), fully describes the spatial and temporal evolution of waves.

- **Linearity of the Wave Equation:** The wave equation is linear, meaning that any linear combination of solutions is also a solution. This allows the most general solution to be expressed as a linear combination of all possible solutions.

- **Boundary and Initial Conditions:** To solve the wave equation for a specific physical system, boundary conditions must be specified. These include the values the wave function takes at the physical boundaries (e.g., $x = 0$ and $x = L$). Initial conditions with respect to time (e.g., at $t = 0$) may also be required.

- **Solution Method for 1D Guitar String:** For a 1D guitar string, the wave equation is solved by separating variables, solving the resulting ordinary differential equations, and then applying boundary conditions at the two ends of the string.

- **Periodic Solutions:** The solution for a 1D guitar string results in an infinite number of periodic solutions, which are parameterized by an integer $n$.

### Classical Wave equation

- **Wave equation** is an example of a second order PDE (partial differential equation). This PDE governs behavior of displacement $u(x,t)$ in time and space.

$$\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2 }= \frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}$$

- **Applications of the Classical Wave Equation:** To illustrate the applications of the classical wave equation, we will solve it for a 1D guitar string. This provides a comprehensive mathematical description of the string's behavior.

- **Predicting Evolution:** By specifying arbitrary initial conditions, the wave equation allows us to precisely predict the evolution of the string over time and space.

### Solving Wave Equation: The big picture 

- **Boundary Conditions:** To solve the wave equation for a specific physical situation, such as a guitar string fixed at both ends, we need to specify two boundary conditions. Mathematically, these are:

$$
u(0, t) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad u(L, t) = 0
$$

where $u(x, t)$ represents the displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$.

- **Separation of Variables:** A common method to solve such equations is the technique of separation of variables. This technique assumes that $x$ and $t$ vary independently of each other, allowing us to express $u(x, t)$ as a product of two functions, each depending on only one variable. This allows us to decompose PDE into Ordinary Differnetial Equations ODEs. 

$$
u(x, t) = X(x) \cdot T(t)
$$

- **Principle of superposition:** The wave equation is linear which you can see by  $u$ terms appearing with first order on both side. Linearity means that linear combination of two solutions $c_1 u_1+c_2u_2$ is also a solution. If you have $n$ particular solutions than you write general solution as linear combination of n terms. 

### Step 1: Plug the Product of Univariate Functions into the Wave Equation

- Start with the 1D wave equation that can describe 1D guitar string:

$$
\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
$$

- Substitute $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$ into the wave equation:

$$
\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 X(x)T(t)}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 X(x)T(t)}{\partial x^2}
$$

- After rearranging, we get:

$$
\frac{X(x)}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 T(t)}{\partial t^2} = T(t)\frac{\partial^2 X(x)}{\partial x^2}
$$

- Thus, we obtain two separate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from the original partial differential equation (PDE):

$$
\frac{1}{T(t)v^2}\frac{\partial^2 T(t)}{\partial t^2} = \frac{1}{X(x)}\frac{\partial^2 X(x)}{\partial x^2} = K
$$

- where $K$ is a constant.


### Step 2: Solving Each Ordinary Differential Equation

After decomposing the PDE into ODEs, we solve each ODE separately:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 T(t)}{\partial t^2} - K T(t) v^2 = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^2 X(x)}{\partial x^2} - K X(x) = 0
$$

:::{admonition} **Solving the spatial part: when $K > 0$**
:class: tip, dropdown

- If $K > 0$, we specify $K = \beta^2$, where $\beta$ is a constant. The general solution for $X(x)$ is represented as linar combination of particular solutions (principle of superposition):

  $$
  X(x) = c_1 e^{\beta x} + c_2 e^{-\beta x}
  $$

  Applying the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(L) = 0$ leads to $c_1 = c_2 = 0$. Since a non-trivial linear combination of two exponential functions cannot be zero everywhere, this results in the trivial solution:

  $$
  X(x) = 0
  $$

  This implies that the string does not moveâ€”no music!

:::

:::{admonition} **Solving the spatial part: when $K < 0$**
:class: tip, dropdown

- If $K < 0$, we specify $K = -\beta^2$, where $\beta$ is a constant. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:

  $$
  X(x) = c_1 e^{i \beta x} + c_2 e^{-i \beta x}
  $$

  Using Euler's formula, this can be rewritten as:

  $$
  X(x) = c_1 (\cos(\beta x) + i \sin(\beta x)) + c_2 (\cos(\beta x) - i \sin(\beta x))
  $$

  Simplifying further:

  $$
  X(x) = (c_1 + i c_2) \cos(\beta x) + (c_1 - i c_2) \sin(\beta x)
  $$

  Let $A = c_1 + i c_2$ and $B = c_1 - i c_2$:

  $$
  X(x) = A \cos(\beta x) + B \sin(\beta x)
  $$

  Applying the boundary conditions $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L) = 0$:

  - At $x = 0$: $A \cdot 1 + B \cdot 0 = 0$, so $A = 0$.
  - At $x = L$: $X(L) = B \sin(\beta L) = 0$.

  For a non-trivial solution, $\sin(\beta L) = 0$, which implies:

  $$
  \beta L = n \pi \quad \text{where} \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
  $$

  Hence:

  $$
  \beta = \frac{n \pi}{L}
  $$

  Thus:

  $$
  X(x) = B \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x \right)
  $$

:::{admonition} **Solving temporal part**
:class: tip, dropdown


- Having identified $K<0$ conditions through solution of spatial part we can now solve for $T(t)$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 T(t)}{\partial t^2} - K v^2 T(t) = 0 \quad \text{with} \quad K = \beta^2
$$

- Substitute $K = \beta^2$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 T(t)}{\partial t^2} - \beta^2 v^2 T(t) = 0
$$

- The solution is:

$$
T(t) = D_n \cos(\omega_n t) + E_n \sin(\omega_n t)
$$

- where $\omega_n = \beta v = \frac{n \pi v}{L}$.
:::


- For spatial part we find solution in the form of sine wave. Where n takes on integer values.

$$
X(x) = B \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x \right)
$$

:::


- For temporal part since we do not have boundary conditions we find solution in the form of linear combination of sine and cosine functions with $\omega_n = \beta v = \frac{n \pi v}{L}$ and $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ represents the normal modes.

$$
T(t) = D_n \cos(\omega_n t) + E_n \sin(\omega_n t)
$$

### Step 3: Combine the Solutions of All ODEs to Obtain the Solution of the Original PDE

- After solving ODEs for spatial adn tempoeral parts we now combine them to obtain the full solution:

$$
u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) = [D_n \cos(\omega_n t) + E_n \sin(\omega_n t)] \cdot B \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x \right)
$$

- Using trig identities, we express the general solution as:

$$
u(x, t) = A \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x \right) \cos (\omega_n t + \phi_n)
$$

- where $A$ and $\phi_n$ are constants which one specifies as part of inititial conditions.

- **The general solution to wave equation is a linear combination of all normal modes**:

$$
u(x, t) = \sum_n A_n \sin \left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x \right) \cdot \cos (\omega_n t + \phi_n)
$$

- This general solution describes the time evolution of any 1D guitar string given initital position and velocity encoded by $A$ and $\phi_n$ constants



### Interpretation of Solution to the Wave Equation

Presented are first six solutions from $n=0,1,2,3,4,5$
:::


- The complete description of any vibrational motion of the guitar string is given by the sum of the normal modes, $X_n(x)$. While the terms involving time, $T_n(t)$, depend on how and where the string is plucked, the normal modes $X_n(x)$ remain the same for a given string.

  $$
  \nu_n = \frac{\omega_n}{2 \pi} = \frac{n \nu}{2L}
  $$

  where $\nu_n$ is the frequency of the $n$-th mode, $\omega_n$ is the angular frequency, $n$ is the mode number, $\nu$ is the wave speed, and $L$ is the length of the string.

- **For $n = 1$**: There are 0 nodes (excluding the endpoints). This is called the fundamental frequency or first harmonic.

- **For $n = 2$**: There is 1 node. This is known as the first overtone or second harmonic.

- **For $n = 3$**: There are 2 nodes. This is called the second overtone or third harmonic.

Vibrations of 2D membrane. 
:::


- Wave function of 2D membrane with fixed edges has two independent variables x and y. Applying the technique of separation of variables we will get three ordinary differential equations.

$$u(x,y,t) =X(x)Y(y)T(t)$$

- This time there will be two boundary conditions fo X and Y
- Boundary on the $X$ edge: $X(0)=X(L)=0$.
- Boundary on the $Y$ edge: $Y(0)=Y(L)=0$.

- Going through exactly the same steps as in 1D case we get full solution expressed as a linear combination of normal modes. 
- The 2D solution is essentially a product of two 1D solutions for each coordinate. Each coordinate has its own independent wave number $k_x$ and $k_y$. 

$$ u(x,y,t) = A_{nm} cos(\omega_{nm}t+\phi_{nm}) sin \frac{n\pi x}{a} sin \frac{m\pi y}{b} $$

- The angular frequency depends on the geometry of the domain and on two integer numbers $n$ and $m$. 

$$\omega_{nm} = v\pi \Big(\frac{n^2}{a^2}+ \frac{m^2}{b^2}\Big)^{1/2} $$

- Can you guess what the solution would be fore the 3D case?


### The sound of music.

 - Music produced by musical instruments is a combination of sound waves with frequencies corresponding to a superposition of normal modes (in music they call harmonics, overtones) of those musical instruments.

The size of the musical instrument reflects the range of frequencies over which the instrument is designed to function. Smaller size implies higher frequencies, larger size implies lower frequencies.

### Example Problems 

#### Problem 1: Simple Harmonic Oscillator

**Problem:**

Solve the ODE:

$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + \omega^2 y = 0
$$

where $\omega$ is a constant.

:::{admonition} **Solution:**
:class: dropdown

The characteristic equation is:

$$
r^2 + \omega^2 = 0
$$

Solving for $r$:

$$
r = \pm i \omega
$$

Thus, the general solution is:

$$
y(t) = C_1 \cos(\omega t) + C_2 \sin(\omega t)
$$

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by initial conditions.

:::

#### Problem 2: Damped Oscillator

Solve the ODE:

$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + 2 \beta \frac{dy}{dt} + \omega^2 y = 0
$$

where $\beta$ and $\omega$ are constants. Consider cases of $\beta^2 < \omega^2$, $\beta^2 > \omega^2$ and $\beta^2 = \omega^2$

:::{admonittion} **Solution:**
:class: dropdown

The characteristic equation is:

$$
r^2 + 2 \beta r + \omega^2 = 0
$$

Solving for $r$ using the quadratic formula:

$$
r = \frac{-2 \beta \pm \sqrt{(2 \beta)^2 - 4 \omega^2}}{2}
$$

$$
r = -\beta \pm \sqrt{\beta^2 - \omega^2}
$$

Depending on the discriminant $\beta^2 - \omega^2$, we have three cases:

1. **Underdamping ($\beta^2 < \omega^2$):**

   $$ 
   y(t) = e^{-\beta t} [C_1 \cos(\omega_d t) + C_2 \sin(\omega_d t)]
   $$

   where $\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega^2 - \beta^2}$.

2. **Critical Damping ($\beta^2 = \omega^2$):**

   $$
   y(t) = (C_1 + C_2 t) e^{-\beta t}
   $$

3. **Overdamping ($\beta^2 > \omega^2$):**

   $$
   y(t) = C_1 e^{r_1 t} + C_2 e^{r_2 t}
   $$

   where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the distinct real roots found from the quadratic formula.

The characteristic equation for this ODE is:

$$
r^2 - 4 = 0
$$

Solving for $r$:

$$
r^2 = 4
$$

$$
r = \pm 2
$$

Thus, the general solution is:

$$
y(t) = C_1 e^{2t} + C_2 e^{-2t}
$$

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by initial conditions.

:::

### Problem 4: Simple 2nd order ODE

$$
r^2 + 9 = 0
$$

Solving for $r$:

$$
r^2 = -9
$$

$$
r = \pm 3i
$$

Thus, the general solution is:

$$
y(t) = C_1 \cos(3t) + C_2 \sin(3t)
$$

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by initial conditions.

:::


### Problem 5: Homogeneous Linear ODE 

Solve the ODE:

$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} - 6 \frac{dy}{dt} + 9 y = 0
$$

:::{admonition} **Solution:**
:class: dropdown

The characteristic equation for this ODE is:

$$
r^2 - 6r + 9 = 0
$$

Factoring:

$$
(r - 3)^2 = 0
$$

Thus:

$$
r = 3 \text{ (repeated root)}
$$

The general solution for repeated roots is:

$$
y(t) = (C_1 + C_2 t) e^{3t}
$$

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by initial conditions.
