    "\n",
    "- **Linearity of the Wave Equation:** The wave equation is linear, meaning that any linear combination of solutions is also a solution. This allows the most general solution to be expressed as a linear combination of all possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boundary and Initial Conditions:** To solve the wave equation for a specific physical system, boundary conditions must be specified. These include the values the wave function takes at the physical boundaries (e.g., $x = 0$ and $x = L$). Initial conditions with respect to time (e.g., at $t = 0$) may also be required.\n",
