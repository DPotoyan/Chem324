# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
## Chem324, Fall 2019 @ Iowa State University
### Instructor: Prof. Davit Potoyan
### TA: Mr. Zachery Crandall

## About 

This is the official website for the Chem324 course **"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"** offered by the Chemistry Department of Iowa State University. This page provides an overview of the website and its broad purpose. 



- These lecture notes incorporate interactive numerical computing visualization, and other media alongisde the tradiionall lecture material. This integrated approach allows seeing both the fundmanetal and applied side of quantum mechanics. Our hope is that by engaging in hands-on numeircal explorations one can demistify complex concepts of quantum mechanics. Additionally quantum emchanics can serve as a good motivator for picking up widely applicable numerical and computaitonal  and data skills. 

  

* All course content is written in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks all of which is hosted on Github. The entire course material is open source and freely available for download and personal use. We are happy to recieve any feedback on any aspect of this course. So feel free to reach us with cool ideas! 

  

* All the code in the notebooks is written using **python3.7**. We  primarily use the standard standard scientific libraries of python **(numpy, spicy, matplotlib)** which are included in the **anaconda3** and **miniconda3** distributions.



## Installing and running Jupyter notebooks/python3.

You have several options for utilizing the jupyter notebooks:



* **Option-1:** You can run the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud of your browser. This option requires no installation!

  

* **Option-2:** You can download **anaconda3 or miniconda3** which contains everything  you need. Any other extra packages can be readily installed through anaconda package manager.

  - **[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)** 

  - **[The Jupyter Intro Guide](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/)** 

    

* **Option-3:**  You can read the content online or download as pdf to be printed for offline reading.
