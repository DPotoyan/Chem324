## About 

This is the official website for Chem324 course "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics" offered by Chemistry Department of Iowa State University.
This pages describes the contents of the website.
* All course content is written in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks and is hosted on Github.
All of the material is open source and freely available for download and personal use.  
* All the code in notebooks is written using python3.7. We use primarily the standard standard scientific libraries of python which are included in anaconda3 distribution.
* Notebooks can be read online or downloaded as pdf or html files from the Github.
* Code in notebooks can be run either in the cloud (no installation required) or locally (after installing anaconda3)
* Official syllabus of the course is available  on Canvas and can also be downloaded from here.  


## Installing and running Jupyter notebooks/python3.

This course will make heavy use of Jupyter notebooks for visualization, interactive exploration of models and symbolic computations.

* Option-1: You can run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud in your browser. This option requires no installation.
* Option-2: You can download anaconda3 which contains everything that you need including python3, scientific and plotting libraries of python. Any extra package can be readily installed using anaconda package manager.

* **[Quickstart](features/features)** Download Anaconda

* **[The Jupyter Book Guide](guide/01_overview)** Quick overview of Jupyter notebooks and python3.

## FAQ  

* Will grades be curved, shifted, calibration etc?: Yes, this is done after midterms and final exams.
* How does grading work: 20% HW, 20% midterm-1, 20% midterm-2, 20% midterm-3, 20% final.  
* What are average values of exam grades? Averages always sit somehwere in 60-70% range. Either naturally or as a result of post-exam grade calibration.
* Materials for the course? This website contains the lecture notes but they are only meant to assit you with learning the material and are NOT subsititute for reading the required book!
* Tips for sucess?: Read the book! Do homework thoroughly. Focus on concepts and ideas and not on meorizing patterns of solving problems. Make use of Jupyter notebook to interactively explore the concepts.
