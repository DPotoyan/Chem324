## Lecture-1 <br>$\color{RoyalBlue}{\text{History of QM: The discovery of energy quantization}}$



* **Energies of atoms and molecules are discrete in other words “quantized”.** Quantized quantity is the opposite to continuous quantities (classical notions of weight, distane etc) as people before advent of quantum mechanicts were accostomed to expect! Hence the name of this course: Quantum Mechanics
* **Quantization of energy is a fundamental aspect of our physical reality and cannot be derived but can be** 
<br> (1) Observed in many experiments. <br> (2) Fully explained by the theory of quantum mechanics as we shall learn in this class.
* **Key historical developments such as <span style="color:maroon">black body radiation, double slit experiment, photoelectric effect </span> are surveyed.**<br>
These classical expeiments show how shocking these observations were to people of early 20th century who were unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. The conclusions of these experiments forced us to abandon classical mechanics for a more fundamental and complete (quantum) theory of the world that can explain phenomena down to smallest particles including atoms, molecules and photons.

This illustration shows the key properties associated with different frequency
regions of electromagnetic waves. Most importantly you see that the high frequency waves carry much higher energy, these are X-ray, Gamma-ray waves and can only be generated by heating “stuff” up at very very high temperatures (e.g core of the sun)! On the other hand low frequency waves can be generated in your “microwave” which you may use to heat up that leftover pizza! The light that is visible to our eyes is located in a narrow frequency region somewhere in between.



 STRICT DEFINITION: “A black body is an idealized physical body which in equilibrium (meaning
 constant Temperature T) both absorbs and emits every wavelength of electromagnetic radiation.
 Since black body is in equilibrium it emits as much energy as it absorbs. The reason its called
 black body is precisely because it absorbs every wavelength that hits the surface thereofore
 appearing as 100% perfect black object. If an object has a color it is because it is reflecting certain
 wavelengths of light which then gets detected by our eye retina. The distribution of wavelengths.



* **Classical mechanics (CM):** Energies can take any value! Just like climbing a continuous ramp.
* **Quantum mechanics:** Energy can only take certain discrete values! More like stairs on a staircase (e.g, 1*E, 2*E 3*E... but not 2.5*E or 1.1*E). Energy is therefore quantized!
