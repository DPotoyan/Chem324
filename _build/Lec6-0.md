## Outline for Lecture 6.0:  "Approximation methods of QM"



- This section will teach us how to make approximations and assess closenss of approximation to reality in a systematic and organized fashion. 
- We will learn two powerful frameworks for making aprpoximations in quantum mechanics: Variational methods and Pertrubation theory. 
- Variational method will give us a stratihforward way of getting the be
- Pertrubation theory will give us simple yet incredibly powerful tool for gleaning inisghts into how pertrubing a  hamitlonian affects the eigneufnctions and eigenvalues. 
- Time-dependent perturbation theory will reveal where the origin of selection rules in spectroscopy.
