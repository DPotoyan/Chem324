## Outline for Lecture 3.2: Postulates of quantum mechanics.  

- **A set of fundamental postulates** make quantum mechanics a self contained fool-proof logical theory. Armed with such a theory all of chemistry and biology “in theory” reduces to mere application of Schrodinger equation. In practice theory is not so easy to apply. 
- **Double slit experiment and quantum weirdness**. Microscopic world has an inherently probabilistic nature where in some sense the very act of observation creates the outcome! Uncertainty relation places rigid bound on the amount of information one can possess about microscopic objects.



## The posutlates

- The state of a system is completely specified by a wave function which contains all the dynamical information. The square of wave function is a probability distribution of finding the object in space.



$$P(x,t)=|\psi(x,t)|^2 \,\,\,   \,\,\, \int |\psi(x,t)|^2 dx=1 $$



- For every observable quantity there is a corresponding linear and Hermitian operator in quantum mechanics.

$$\hat{A} (c_1 \psi_i+c_2 \psi_2) =  c_1 \hat{A}\psi_i+c_2 \hat{A}\psi_2$$

$$\int \psi^* (\hat{A}\phi) dx = \int \phi (\hat{A} \psi)^* dx$$

- Eigenvalues of operators are the only possible values of observables that can be measured in experiments

$$\hat{A}\psi_n =a_n \psi_n $$

- Expectation or the average value of observable in a state given by a wave 
  function is given by expression:

- Time evolution of wave function is governed by time-dependent Schrodinger equation.



### Postulate #1 Wave function beahviour

Wave function that describes real physical objects should be well behaved in order to correspond to probability distribution.

- Continuous, single-valued, differentiable and finite over finite range. 
- Functions that do not satisfy these criteria are discarded as non-physical.  



### Application of Postulate #1: tunneling in a finite box.
