## Outline for Lecture 5.0:  "Hydrogen atom"

- Hydrogen atom is the simplest atom for which Schrodinge equation can be solved exactly. He atom which only has one more electron already proves to be impossible to solve exactly. 
- The solution of the Schrödinger equation for H atom uses the fact that the Coulomb potential produced by the nucleus is isotropic: it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus. This symmetry gives rise to degenercaies in energy levels. 
- Although the resulting energy eigenfunctions (the orbitals) are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the angular coordinates follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential.
- The angular momentum is conserved, therefore, the energy eigenvalues may be classified by two angular momentum quantum numbers, ℓ and m (both are integers) and quantize mangitude and projection of angular momentum. 
- Atomic orbitals are introduced which are used for also describing multi-electron atoms and molecules.
