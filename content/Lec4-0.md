## Outline for Lecture 4.0:  

Have found that energy of bound systems is quantized. On the example of exactly solvable simple toy systems  we  now study the specifics of quantization of different degrees of freedom (DOF) found in molecules. 

- Particle in a box. (quantization of translational DOF)
- Harmonic oscillator (quantization of vibrational DOF)
- Rigid rotort.  (quantization of rotational DOF)



# Big picture: Energies of molecules

Molecules have different kinds of motions which can be classified into translational, rotational, vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. Due to the fact that molecules are microscopic objects we expect these energies to all be quantized. The relative spacings, however, are going to be different to a signficant extent due to boundary conditions restricting the motions of these DOFs. This is why there are different spectrosocopies for probing these degrees of freedom:

$$E= \epsilon_{trans}+ \epsilon_{rot}+ \epsilon_{vib}+\epsilon_{elec}$$
