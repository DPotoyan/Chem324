## About 

This is the official website for the Chem324 course **"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"** offered by the Chemistry Department of Iowa State University.

This page provides an overview of the website and its broad purpose. 



- The cours eincorporates interactive numerical computing visualization, gifs and other media to aid in comprehension of complex concepts. 

* All course content is written in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks all of which is hosted on Github.

* The entire course material is open source and freely available for download and personal use. We are happy to recieve any feedback on any aspect of this course. So feel free to reach us with cool ideas! 

* All the code in the notebooks is written using **python3.7**. We  primarily use the standard standard scientific libraries of python **(numpy, spicy, matplotlib)** which are included in the **anaconda3** and **miniconda3** distributions.

* Jupyter notebooks can be useufl in a number of ways:

  * You can read their content online. 
  * You can ownload notebooks as pdf or html files from the Github. 
  * Most importantly you can runnotebooks in the cloud (via **myBinder or Google Collaboratery**)
  * Finally if you install anaconda or minicodna distributions locally you can run them on your laptop, modify and save.

  


## Installing and running Jupyter notebooks/python3.

This course will make heavy use of Jupyter notebooks for numerical computing visualization, interactive exploration. There are two options to run the notebooks:

* **Option-1:** You can run the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud of your browser. This option requires no installation.
* **Option-2:** You can download **anaconda3 or miniconda3** which contains everything  you need. Any other extra packages can be readily installed through anaconda package manager.

* **[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)** 

* **[The Jupyter Intro Guide](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/)**
