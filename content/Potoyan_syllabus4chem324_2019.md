**1. Learning Objectives and Outcomes:** In Chem 324 you will learn how quantum mechanics describes features of nature that classical mechanics cannot by using mathematical and conceptual tools.  In addition, you will learn how quantization of energy is manifested in real-world situations, especially spectroscopy and molecular bonding. You are responsible for learning, understanding, and applying all subjects and concepts listed in this syllabus and presented throughout the course. Prerequisites for Chemistry 324 include Chem 178, Math 166. Phys 222 recommended. Chemistry 324 is a 3 credit course (**attendance is highly recommended**). 

**2. Required Materials:** Textbook: “Quantum Chemistry” 2nd edition – D McQuarrie, University Science Books, 2007 ("Brown book cover").<br>

 Recommended reading: J. Griffitsh “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics” (Pearson Prentice Hall 2nd ed, 2004). Required: A scientific calculator (with the functions: ln(x), ex, 10x, yx) is essential. Graphing calculators are allowed except TI 89 calculators or other calculators that can do analytical integration of functions. However, you must arrive a few minutes before the exam and show the Teaching Assistant (TA) that you have cleared the memory. 

**3. Assignments:** Assignments will be posted on Canvas with due dates. Problems are due at the end of class on the due date - no exceptions, no excuses, unless the Dean of Students notifies me that you have a personal emergency. No credit will be received for homework sets handed in late. Each problem will get a score of 0 (no reasonable attempt), 1 (reasonable attempt, but not correct), or 2 (correct). Feel free to work with other students on the homework, but you must turn in your own individual set of solutions – no plagiarism is allowed. Answers to problem sets will be posted to Canvas after the class when the assignment is due. The problem assignments along with in-class quizzes and exercises will account for 15% of the grade. Note: Illegible exams or problem sets will NOT be graded. All work must be presented reasonably neatly and logically. 

**4. Exams:** There will be three 50 minute exams (each worth 20% of the final grade) and a *comprehensive* final exam (20% of the final grade). The 50 minute exams are **NOT** night exams and are scheduled for the regular class period on: **Sep 20, Oct 21, Nov 22.** The final exam is scheduled from **9:45-11:45pm** on **Dec 16.** The date/time for the final exam is still to be determined and will be announced as soon as the information is available. Please note that the final exam date and time are set by the University and will not be changed, so do not plan to leave the University before the exam date. Graduating seniors MUST take the final exam. **Make-up exams will be administered only in exceptional cases**, which must be discussed with the instructor and which absolutely requires documentation. In some cases, at the instructor’s discretion, in lieu of a make-up exam, the final grade may be comprised of the remaining requirements, each taking on a proportionally higher weighting. 

**5. Grading:** The final letter grades will determined to be consistent with other 324 sections, but will not be graded harder than a standard grading scale. The grade will be 20% from problem assignments, in-class quizzes and exercises, 20% from each of the three 50 minute exams and 20% from the final exam. 

**6. Dead Week:** This class follows the Iowa State University Dead Week policy as noted in section 10.6.4 of the Faculty Handbook: http://www.provost.iastate.edu/resources/faculty-handbook. The final problem set **will** be due on the Friday of dead week. 

**7. Accessibility Statement:** Iowa State University is committed to assuring that all educational activities are free from discrimination and harassment based on disability status.  Students requesting accommodations for a documented disability are required to work directly with staff in Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to establish eligibility and learn about related processes before accommodations will be identified.  After eligibility is established, SAS staff will create and issue a Notification Letter for each course listing approved reasonable accommodations.  This document will be made available to the student and instructor either electronically or in hard-copy every semester.  Students and instructors are encouraged to review contents of the Notification Letters as early in the semester as possible to identify a specific, timely plan to deliver/receive the indicated accommodations.  Reasonable accommodations are not retroactive in nature and are not intended to be an unfair advantage.  Additional information or assistance is available online at [www.sas.dso.iastate.edu](http://www.sas.dso.iastate.edu/), by contacting SAS staff by email at [accessibility@iastate.edu](mailto:accessibility@iastate.edu), or by calling 515-294-7220. Student Accessibility Services is a unit in the Dean of Students Office located at 1076 Student Services Building.

**8. Teaching Assistant:** Zachery Crandall (**zachcran@iastate.edu **) is the TA for the course. The TA will have an additional **study session** with the time to be determined at the beginning of the course. 

**9. Canvas:** Canvas will be central to disseminate information (such as lectures and problem sets) and announcements for the class. Canvas will also be used to post supplementary information that can help with understanding the concepts of the course. 

**10. E-mail:** We strongly encourage students to post on **discussion board on Canvas** when asking subject related questions. This way the whole class will be engaged and can benefit from the answer. If you send an individual email then please put **Chem 324:** at the beginning of the subject. This will help Davit and Will see your questions in their mailboxes and to put priority on answering these e-mails. 

**11. Additional office information:** Davit’s office is in Gillman Hall building on second floor, room #2759. 

**12. Classroom etiquette:** It is expected that you will respect your fellow students, TA and the instructor during the class. Cell phone and other electronic communication device use during lecture is strictly forbidden. In class cell-phone and communication device use will result in a zero grade for any assignment associated with that class **including exams** and may impact your grade significantly. Laptops are allowed in class if they are only used to take notes for the class. People who read newspapers, carry on extended conversations during class, or engage in other distracting behavior, will be asked to leave. 

**13. Academic Dishonesty:** The class will follow Iowa State University’s policy on academic dishonesty. Anyone suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office: https://language.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AcademicMisconduct.pdf

**14. Right to Privacy:** The Federal Right-to-Privacy Act prohibits the instructor from public disclosure of exam scores. You may obtain your exam scores in person from your instructor or TA or from the Canvas grade book. The instructor and the TA are prohibited from giving grades over the phone or e-mail. 

**15. Harrassment and Discrimination:** Iowa State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of work and study for faculty, staff, and students that is free of all forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based upon race, ethnicity, sex (including sexual assault), pregnancy, color, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or status as a U.S. veteran. Any student who has concerns about such behavior should contact his/her instructor, Student Assistance at 515-294-1020 or email dso-sas@iastate.edu, or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance at 515-294-7612. 

**16. Religious Accommodation:** If an academic or work requirement conflicts with your religious practices and/or observances, you may request reasonable accommodations. Your request must be in writing, and your instructor or supervisor will review the request. You or your instructor may also seek assistance from the Dean of Students Office or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance.
